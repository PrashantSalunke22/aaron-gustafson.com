Have you ever heard the name Alan Emtage? Probably not. He didn’t start a nearly trillion-dollar company. He isn’t digging massive tunnels under cities. His pet project isn’t putting people on Mars. But he wrote the first search engine way back in 1990.

Hailing from Barbados, Alan Emtage was working on his Masters Degree at the School of Computer Science at McGill University in the late 1980s and early 1990s. While attending McGill, he was also working as a systems administrator for his department. As part of this work, he became the go-to person to help the faculty and his fellow students locate open source software on the early Internet. To automate things a bit, he built a rudimentary database that would keep an index of all of the files spread across the network. Still, he was the gatekeeper of this data.
