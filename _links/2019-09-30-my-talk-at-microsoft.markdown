I wasn’t there for the talk, but Richard Stallman spoke at Microsoft earlier this month and offered 10 suggestions to the company. The one that stood out to me was this:

> Help make the web usable with Javascript deactivated.

Amen.

For what it’s worth, this is [not a problem of capability](https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/how-to-apply-progressive-enhancement-when-javascript-seems-like-a-requirement/). You can build just about every kind of website and web-based software without requiring JavaScript. Sure, it would be a challenge to build a real-time video or image editor online without JavaScript, but let’s face fact: most of us are not building those kinds of tools.

Rather than being a capability issue, our over-reliance on JavaScript has more to do with developers approach to the web. Many see it like any other software platform. [It’s not](https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/a-fundamental-disconnect/). The web is different and building well (and resiliently) for it requires competence in all three languages that make it possible: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Most devs over-index on only one of those and it’s a problem.
