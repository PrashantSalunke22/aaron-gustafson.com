Progressive enhancement sounds practical, but not for your current project, right? Good news: you’re wrong!

In this session, Aaron will debunk the myths that often preclude individuals and organizations from embracing progressive enhancement and demonstrate solid techniques for applying progressive enhancement in your work.

By the end of this session, you’ll walk away with

* a better sense of the devices people are using to access the Web,
* a framework for envisioning experience as a continuum, and
* a solid understanding of how to improve the accessibility and reach of your Web projects.
Come find out why progressive enhancement isn’t just for “content” sites (whatever those are).
